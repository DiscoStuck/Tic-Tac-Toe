# Tic-Tac-Toe

## The Odin Project

- This is a project done following the course "The Odin Project".
- All the code is original and created from scratch by myself.

## Non-responsive

- Since there are still more lessons about responsive design, this project is focused on the logic behind the app.

## AI

- AI player implementation seems to be way out of my knowledge at the moment, so it is left undone.
- I will leave that door open to add that functionality in the future.
